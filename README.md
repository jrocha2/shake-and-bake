This is the source code for my personal baking and cooking website.

## The Source Code

Since the website is mostly meant to serve static content (pictures or recipes), I thought I would try out a static site generator and the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). You can find a million things to read about it online. Below is a few components I use in the project
- **Gatsby** - Static Site Generator
- **React** - The JS library used to build the underlying pages
- **Material-UI** - The UI Framework for styling
- **Netlify** - Website building and hosting
